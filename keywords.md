# About Keyword Searches
To help refine your search, you can include or exclude keywords. Any keywords specified will search the following fields: product title, the product URL, the manufacturer name, and the retailer's name. Example of each of these are:

- **product title** - `TulAmmo 9mm Full Metal Jacket Polymer Coated Steel Case, 115 Grain, 1150 fps, 50 Round Box, TA919150`
- **product URL** - `https://www.laxammo.com/handgun/9mm-ammo/fiocchi-9-mm-subsonic-158-gr-fmj-9ape-detail`
- **manufacturer name** - `Tula`
- **retailer's name** - `Lax Ammo`

# Important Considerations

- Keyword searches are case insensitive, so a search for `jhp` is the same as a search for `JHP`.
- Keywords should be separated by spaces. Do not use commas.
- All characters in keywords are treated literally. No wildcards or regular expressions at this time (but perhaps in the future!)
- Multi-word phrases are not supported at this time, so quotes are not useful.
- You are allowed up to 10 keywords to include, and 10 keywords to exclude.

# Keyword Search Examples

- To search specifically for XM855 ammo, put `XM855` in the Include Keywords box.
- To search only items from luckygunner.com, put `luckygunner.com` in the Include Keywords box.
- To find lead-free ammo, try putting `lead-free` in the Include Keywords box.
- To permanently exclude products from particular retailers, do not use the Exclude Keywords box. Instead, use the [Exclude Retailers](exclude-retailers) feature.
