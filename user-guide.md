# Take a guided Tour
Welcome to AmmoSeek! If you're new to our site, the first thing you may wish to do is take a guided tour. Simply click on the **Help** button at the top of the page and then select **Tour AmmoSeek** from the pulldown menu. Note that when you visit AmmoSeek.com for the very first time you should receive a dialog window pop-up that welcomes you to the site and asks if you'd like to take the tour.

The screenshot below shows where to access the tour if you didn't receive this popup or if you'd like to initiate the tour again.

# Searching for Ammunition
Our claim to fame is our ability to search many online retailers for in-stock ammunition with a quick search on [AmmoSeek.com](https://ammoseek.com). Our ammunition searches are broken down into four sections: handgun, rifle, rimfire, and shotgun. We support over 350 calibers. A full list of our calibers can be found here: http://ammoseek.com/calibers/

## Quick Methods
**Use the Caliber Search Box/Area**
> Start typing a caliber in the search box in the upper right-hand corner, and select a caliber that comes up to jump straight to those search results. Note that this is for searching for ammunition only!

# Using Keywords in Searches
To help refine your search, you can include or exclude keywords. Any keywords specified will search the following fields: product title, the product URL, the manufacturer name, and the retailer's name. Example of each of these are:
- **product title** - `TulAmmo 9mm Full Metal Jacket Polymer Coated Steel Case, 115 Grain, 1150 fps, 50 Round Box, TA919150`
- **product URL** - `https://www.laxammo.com/handgun/9mm-ammo/fiocchi-9-mm-subsonic-158-gr-fmj-9ape-detail`
- **manufacturer name** - `Tula`
- **retailer's name** - `Lax Ammo`

## Important Considerations
- Keyword searches are case insensitive, so a search for `jhp` is the same as a search for `JHP`.
- Keywords should be separated by spaces. Do not use commas.
- All characters in keywords are treated literally. No wildcards or regular expressions at this time (but perhaps in the future!)
- Multi-word phrases are not supported at this time, so quotes are not useful.
- You are allowed up to 10 keywords to include, and 10 keywords to exclude.

## Keyword Search Examples
- To search specifically for XM855 ammo, put `XM855` in the Include Keywords box.
- To search only items from luckygunner.com, put `luckygunner.com` in the Include Keywords box.
- To find lead-free ammo, try putting `lead-free` in the Include Keywords box.
- To permanently exclude products from particular retailers, do not use the Exclude Keywords box. Instead, use the [Exclude Retailers](exclude-retailers) feature.

# Reading the Search Results
The search results pages contains a lot of information you might find useful. Most fields (Retailer Name, Description, Manufacturer, Caliber, etc.) are self explanatory. Below is some additional information about other fields:
- **Share** - clicking the ![Share](/uploads/share.png "Share") icon lets you easily share the product via social channels (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.)
- **When** - this column tell you how long it's been since our database has been updated for this product.
- **Limits** - this column alerts you if the retailer has any set purchase limits for the product (e.g. max ![Limit 1](/uploads/limit-1.png "Limit 1") box per customer)
- **New?** - this column lets you know if the product is in factory new condition (![New](/uploads/new.png "New")), remanufactured (![Remanufactured](/uploads/remanufactured.png "Remanufactured")), or factory seconds (![Factoryseconds](/uploads/factoryseconds.png "Factoryseconds"))
- **S/H** - this column gives you our metered rating for the average shipping costs for retailer in question. [See details on our Shipping Estimation here](https://a.ammoseek.com/shipping_estimation/).
- **Err?** - If you notice a discrepancy in our data, click the green flag (![Greenflag](/uploads/greenflag.png "Greenflag")) to let us know what's wrong. If there's already a ![Discrepancy](/uploads/discrepancy.png "Discrepancy") symbol, it means someone else has already submitted a discrepancy report for that item.

**NOTE**: on mobile and smaller devices, the results page will have only a few basic fields, with an extra **Details** button you can click to see everything:
