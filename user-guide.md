# Take a guided Tour
Welcome to AmmoSeek! If you're new to our site, the first thing you may wish to do is take a guided tour. Simply click on the **Help** button at the top of the page and then select **Tour AmmoSeek** from the pulldown menu. Note that when you visit AmmoSeek.com for the very first time you should receive a dialog window pop-up that welcomes you to the site and asks if you'd like to take the tour.

The screenshot below shows where to access the tour if you didn't receive this popup or if you'd like to initiate the tour again.

# Searching for Ammunition
Our claim to fame is our ability to search many online retailers for in-stock ammunition with a quick search on [AmmoSeek.com](https://ammoseek.com). Our ammunition searches are broken down into four sections: handgun, rifle, rimfire, and shotgun. We support over 350 calibers. A full list of our calibers can be found here: http://ammoseek.com/calibers/

## Quick Methods
**Use the Caliber Search Box/Area**
> Start typing a caliber in the search box in the upper right-hand corner, and select a caliber that comes up to jump straight to those search results. Note that this is for searching for ammunition only!
![Calibersearchbox](/uploads/calibersearchbox.png "Calibersearchbox")

**Use a Quick Seek Link**
> If your caliber is one of the most popular, click on one of the **Quick Seek** links.
![Quickseeklinks](/uploads/quickseeklinks.png "Quickseeklinks")

**Choose Your Ammo Type**

{.is-success}

# Using Keywords in Searches
To help refine your search, you can include or exclude keywords. Any keywords specified will search the following fields: product title, the product URL, the manufacturer name, and the retailer's name. Example of each of these are:
- **product title** - `TulAmmo 9mm Full Metal Jacket Polymer Coated Steel Case, 115 Grain, 1150 fps, 50 Round Box, TA919150`
- **product URL** - `https://www.laxammo.com/handgun/9mm-ammo/fiocchi-9-mm-subsonic-158-gr-fmj-9ape-detail`
- **manufacturer name** - `Tula`
- **retailer's name** - `Lax Ammo`

## Important Considerations
- Keyword searches are case insensitive, so a search for `jhp` is the same as a search for `JHP`.
- Keywords should be separated by spaces. Do not use commas.
- All characters in keywords are treated literally. No wildcards or regular expressions at this time (but perhaps in the future!)
- Multi-word phrases are not supported at this time, so quotes are not useful.
- You are allowed up to 10 keywords to include, and 10 keywords to exclude.

## Keyword Search Examples
- To search specifically for XM855 ammo, put `XM855` in the Include Keywords box.
- To search only items from luckygunner.com, put `luckygunner.com` in the Include Keywords box.
- To find lead-free ammo, try putting `lead-free` in the Include Keywords box.
- To permanently exclude products from particular retailers, do not use the Exclude Keywords box. Instead, use the [Exclude Retailers](exclude-retailers) feature.

# Reading the Search Results
The search results pages contains a lot of information you might find useful. Most fields (Retailer Name, Description, Manufacturer, Caliber, etc.) are self explanatory. Below is some additional information about other fields:
- **Share** - clicking the ![Share](/uploads/share.png "Share") icon lets you easily share the product via social channels (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.)
- **When** - this column tell you how long it's been since our database has been updated for this product.
- **Limits** - this column alerts you if the retailer has any set purchase limits for the product (e.g. max ![Limit 1](/uploads/limit-1.png "Limit 1") box per customer)
- **New?** - this column lets you know if the product is in factory new condition (![New](/uploads/new.png "New")), remanufactured (![Remanufactured](/uploads/remanufactured.png "Remanufactured")), or factory seconds (![Factoryseconds](/uploads/factoryseconds.png "Factoryseconds"))
- **S/H** - this column gives you our metered rating for the average shipping costs for retailer in question. [See details on our Shipping Estimation here](https://a.ammoseek.com/shipping_estimation/).
- **Err?** - If you notice a discrepancy in our data, click the green flag (![Greenflag](/uploads/greenflag.png "Greenflag")) to let us know what's wrong. If there's already a ![Discrepancy](/uploads/discrepancy.png "Discrepancy") symbol, it means someone else has already submitted a discrepancy report for that item.

**NOTE**: on mobile and smaller devices, the results page will have only a few basic fields, with an extra **Details** button you can click to see everything:
![Mobileresultsdetailsbutton](/uploads/mobileresultsdetailsbutton.png "Mobileresultsdetailsbutton")

{.is-warning}

## Verifying your mobile phone number
If you specified a mobile phone number when you signed up for an account, you will need to verify that it is indeed yours.
If you were unable to (or chose not to) verify your mobile phone number during the sign-up process, you still have the opportunity. Simply follow these steps:

If you are not logged into AmmoSeek.com, do so by clicking the ![Signupsigninbutton](/uploads/signupsigninbutton.png "Signupsigninbutton") at the top of the page, next to the AmmoSeek logo. (On mobile devices, this is found under the ![Hamburgermenusmall](/uploads/hamburgermenusmall.png "Hamburgermenusmall") hamburger menu).

Once you are logged in, click the user button with your name on it.
![Userbutton](/uploads/userbutton.png "Userbutton")

Then select **Account Settings** from the user menu.
![Accountsettings](/uploads/accountsettings.png "Accountsettings")

On the **Account Settings** screen, double-check to make sure the mobile phone number you entered is correct, and then press the **Save** button. You will then have to enter the code texted to you to verify the number you provided is yours.
![Accountsettingsform](/uploads/accountsettingsform.png "Accountsettingsform")

If you wish to save your account settings without verifying your mobile phone, simply clear out the mobile phone number field. You are free to supply it at a later date, if you wish.

# Saved Searches
Once you have crafted your search the way you want it, and the search results are showing you what you expect, you can save your search for quick retrieval later.

First, make sure you are logged into AmmoSeek.com. You should see your name in the user button at the top of the site next to the AmmoSeek logo.

Simply click the **Save This Search & Set Alert** button
![Savesearchsetalert](/uploads/savesearchsetalert.png "Savesearchsetalert")

Your search will be saved, and then you have a choice to [set an alert](alerts) or **Close** the confirmation dialog to go back to the search results screen. Now, in the left-hand column you'll see a list of your saved searches, organized by product type (ammo, magazines, guns, etc). At any time all you have to do is click the link corresponding to the search in order to run the search again.

## Modifying Saved Searches
Currently you cannot modify a saved search. What you *can* do, however, is just as easy:
1. Click on the one you wish to modify to execute the search.
1. Modify your search parameters on the search results screen.
1. Click the orange "Save Search" button to save the new search
1. Delete the old search, if desired.

## Deleting Saved Searches
To view/modify your list of Saved Searches, click the User button at the top of the page (or under the ![Hamburgermenusmall](/uploads/hamburgermenusmall.png "Hamburgermenusmall") hamburger menu on mobile devices)., and select **Saved Searches** from the pulldown.

![Savedsearchesoption](/uploads/savedsearchesoption.png "Savedsearchesoption")

Click the small trash can ![Trashcan](/uploads/trashcan.png "Trashcan") next to a Saved Search to delete it.
Once deleted, a saved search cannot be retrieved.

# Alerting (Price Alerts)
If you have an account on AmmoSeek.com and are logged in, you can set price thresholds for products that match a Saved Search. If the price threshold is reached, you will immediately be emailed an alert. If you have a mobile phone number activated in your account, you will also receive a text message to alert you.

## How Alerts Work
We check literally every few minutes to see if your price thresholds have been met. For example, if you set an alert for $400 or less for a Glock 22, and one comes available for $390, we'll immediately send you an alert with a link to your saved search. Also, we'll automatically deactivate your alert for you (otherwise, you'll be alerted again in about 3 minutes, and again about 3 minutes after that, forever, until the product is no longer available or you log in and manually turn it off).

## Setting Alerts
To set an alert immediately after saving a search, you can ![1 25 X 25](/uploads/1-25-x-25.png "1 25 X 25") set an alert threshold (cost per unit), and ![2 25 X 25](/uploads/2-25-x-25.png "2 25 X 25") activate the alert.
![Setalertaftersavingsearch](/uploads/setalertaftersavingsearch.png "Setalertaftersavingsearch")

At any other time, you can click on the user menu and select **Manage Alerts**
![Managealertsoption](/uploads/managealertsoption.png "Managealertsoption")

First, you must create a price threshold. Let's use the following example:
![Setalert](/uploads/setalert.png "Setalert")

It shows that the lowest price at the moment is 17.1¢ per round.

![1 25 X 25](/uploads/1-25-x-25.png "1 25 X 25") Enter **0.15** into the **Alert Threshold** box in order to be alerted if this same search yields a product that's 15¢ per round or less. If the item currently does not show up in your search, it would say the Current Low is **[none]**. So if you'd like to be alerted when the item appears (at any price), then enter a value of **any**.
![2 25 X 25](/uploads/2-25-x-25.png "2 25 X 25") Then, in order to save this threshold and make the alert '**active**' you must move the **Active** slider to ![Slideron](/uploads/slideron.png "Slideron")

## Deactivating Alerts
Click on the user menu and select **Manage Alerts**
![Managealertsoption](/uploads/managealertsoption.png "Managealertsoption")

Then, move the slider to ![Slideroff](/uploads/slideroff.png "Slideroff") for the alert you wish to deactivate.

# Exclude Retailers from your search results
If there are retailers you know you'd like to avoid, you can set it up so that you never see any products from those retailers in your search results.

Click on the user menu and select Exclude Retailers
![Excluderetailersoption](/uploads/excluderetailersoption.png "Excluderetailersoption")

Select as many retailers you'd like to exclude from all searches.

Click in the box to pull down a list of retailers.
![Excluderetailers 1](/uploads/excluderetailers-1.png "Excluderetailers 1")

Then select as many retailers as you'd like. Each time you select one from the pulldown menu, it gets added to the box at the top. To remove a retailer click the X next to the corresponding retailer you wish to remove from the exclusion list.
![Exclude Retailers 2 5](/uploads/exclude-retailers-2-5.png "Exclude Retailers 2 5")

When you're finished, click outside the pulldown menu (to the left or right) and then click the ![Savebutton](/uploads/savebutton.png "Savebutton") button.
