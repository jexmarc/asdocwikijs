<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Ammunition Glossary -->

Confused by bullet abbreviations an acronyms used by manufacturers? We'll tell you what they mean and how they're used so you can pick the right one. This document was apropriated from an old glossary posted by CheaperThanDirt back when AmmoSeek started, so they deserve most of the credit for this. For some reason it is no longer available on their site, and an AmmoSeeker noticed this and suggested we take over the content ourselves... so we did.

>  # AP: armor-piercing
> Military bullets with steel or tungsten core that penetrates steel armor. Bullet's tip is usually painted black for easier identification.

> # API: armor-piercing incendiary
> Designed to penetrate armor and set target on fire. Tips are usually painted light blue.

> # BBWC: bevel-base wadcutter
> Pistol bullet that's float on both ends; has beveled base to increase accuracy similar to a boat-tail bullet


> # BEB: brass-enclosed base
> Pistol bullet with brass plug over exposed lead base to reduce lead exposure. Many indoor ranges now specify use of this bullet to decrease lead contamination.

> # BJHP: brass-jacketed hollow point
> Defensive pistol bullet that controls mushrooming and energy release over longer distances.


> # BST: Ballistic Silvertip
> Used with hunting rifles, this Winchester bullet has a soft metal tip that causes rapid expansion and penetration of bullet. Typically used for varminting and hunting light- and medium-size game.


> # BT: boat-tail 
> Rifle bullet with truncated conical shape at base of bullet. Streamlining stabilizes bullet and increases accuracy.


> # BTHP: boat-tail hollow point
> Same as plain boat-tail but with a hollow point, which generates rapid expansion and penetration.

> # BTSP: boat-tail soft point
> Like the plain boat-tail but with a soft point to increase penetration and expansion from exposed lead tip.


> # BRPT: bronze point
> Bronze insert in tip improves trajectory, velocity and energy transfer at extreme ranges. Tip expands rapidly when driven back through bullet. Excellent design for hunting long-range medium-size game.

> # CC: copper-coated
> Same as full-metal-jacket. Copper coating prevents bullet deformation in feed mechanism and barrel, reduces misfires and lowers risk of barrel damage.

> # CP: copper-plated
> Lead bullet dipped in copper; reduces lead fouling and is cheaper than copper coating.

> # CL: Core-Lokt 
> Remington's premier bonded bullet. Retains up to 95% of original weight with maximum penetration and energy transfer. Progressively tapered jacket initiates and controls expansion nearly 2x. Unique design and bonded lead core delivers performance from 50 to 500 yards.

> # ENCAP: encapsulated
> Totally plated on all sides to decrease environmental lead contamination. Many indoor ranges use this ammunition exclusively to reduce lead clean-up costs.

> # EFMJ: expanding full metal jacket 
> Federal's answer to areas with restrictions on hollow points. A regular full-metal-jacket bullet with front rubber core covered by a copper jacket. When fired into target media, copper jacket collapses along serrations, produces petal-like expansion and delivers energy without over-penetration.

> # EP: Expanding Point
> Winchester-developed bullet for .25ACP for better stopping power for small calibers. Hollow point with round lead ball inserted into cavity ensures positive feed, increases expansion and transfers energy rapidly.

> # ERBT: Extended-Range Boat-tail
