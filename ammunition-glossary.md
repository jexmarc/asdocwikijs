<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Ammunition Glossary -->

Confused by bullet abbreviations an acronyms used by manufacturers? We'll tell you what they mean and how they're used so you can pick the right one. This document was apropriated from an old glossary posted by CheaperThanDirt back when AmmoSeek started, so they deserve most of the credit for this. For some reason it is no longer available on their site, and an AmmoSeeker noticed this and suggested we take over the content ourselves... so we did.

>  # AP: armor-piercing
> Military bullets with steel or tungsten core that penetrates steel armor. Bullet's tip is usually painted black for easier identification.

> # API: armor-piercing incendiary
> Designed to penetrate armor and set target on fire. Tips are usually painted light blue.

> # BBWC: bevel-base wadcutter
> Pistol bullet that's float on both ends; has beveled base to increase accuracy similar to a boat-tail bullet


> # BEB: brass-enclosed base
> Pistol bullet with brass plug over exposed lead base to reduce lead exposure. Many indoor ranges now specify use of this bullet to decrease lead contamination.
