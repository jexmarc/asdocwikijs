<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Alerts -->

If you have an account on AmmoSeek.com and are logged in, you can set price thresholds for products that match a Saved Search. If the price threshold is reached, you will immediately be emailed an alert. If you have a mobile phone number activated in your account, you will also receive a text message to alert you.

# How Alerts Work
We check literally every few minutes to see if your price thresholds have been met. For example, if you set an alert for $400 or less for a Glock 22, and one comes available for $390, we'll immediately send you an alert with a link to your saved search. Also, we'll automatically deactivate your alert for you (otherwise, you'll be alerted again in about 3 minutes, and again about 3 minutes after that, forever, until the product is no longer available or you log in and manually turn it off).

# Setting Alerts
To set an alert immediately after saving a search, you can ![1 25 X 25](/uploads/1-25-x-25.png "1 25 X 25") set an alert threshold (cost per unit), and ![2 25 X 25](/uploads/2-25-x-25.png "2 25 X 25") activate the alert.

At any other time, you can click on the user menu and select **Manage Alerts**

First, you must create a price threshold. Let's use the following example:

![Setalert](/uploads/setalert.png "Setalert")

It shows that the lowest price at the moment is 17.1¢ per round.

![1 25 X 25](/uploads/1-25-x-25.png "1 25 X 25") Enter **0.15** into the **Alert Threshold** box in order to be alerted if this same search yields a product that's 15¢ per round or less. If the item currently does not show up in your search, it would say the Current Low is **[none]**. So if you'd like to be alerted when the item appears (at any price), then enter a value of **any**.
![2 25 X 25](/uploads/2-25-x-25.png "2 25 X 25") Then, in order to save this threshold and make the alert '**active**' you must move the **Active** slider to ![Slideron](/uploads/slideron.png "Slideron")

# Deactivating Alerts
Click on the user menu and select **Manage Alerts**

![Managealertsoption](/uploads/managealertsoption.png "Managealertsoption")

Then, move the slider to ![Slideroff](/uploads/slideroff.png "Slideroff") for the alert you wish to deactivate.
