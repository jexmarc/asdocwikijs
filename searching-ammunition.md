<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Searching Ammunition -->

Our claim to fame is our ability to search many online retailers for in-stock ammunition with a quick search on [AmmoSeek.com](https://ammoseek.com). Our ammunition searches are broken down into four sections: handgun, rifle, rimfire, and shotgun. We support over 350 calibers. A full list of our calibers can be found here: http://ammoseek.com/calibers/

# Quick Methods

Start typing a caliber in the search box in the upper right-hand corner, and select a caliber that comes up to jump straight to those search results.
