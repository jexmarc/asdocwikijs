# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
## Why don't you show the ammo prices including shipping rates?
We rate each retailer on their average shipping costs. See our Shipping Estimation page for more details. Some sites (e.g. gun-deals.com) purport to factor shipping charges into the price of of the product, but you will notice that not all products have shipping information added in, and the ones that do aren't necessarily accurate since shipping charges vary widely depending on whether or not other items are also purchased at the same time. Plus, some retailers offer free (or very inexpensive) shipping because they already add in the cost of shipping to the price of the product. Therefore, with such varying levels of accuracy, it makes comparison shopping much less clear than if the basic price of the item is used.

## How can I find lead-free ammunition?
Typically entering the keyword `lead-free` into the include keywords search box for a given caliber will yield good results for lead-free / non-lead ammunition.

## Do you sell ammo? What are your shipping rates?
We do not sell ammunition. AmmoSeek is a search engine for finding in-stock ammunition at online retailers. We do not stock or sell ammunition; therefore, we do not have shipping rates.

## Hi, I'm an avid shooter and have some leftover XXX Ammo to sell. How can I sell it on your site?
I'm sorry but we only list in-stock ammo (and related products) for retailers that have an ongoing business selling online via an ecommerce site. There is a great website for what you want to do though. Check out Gunbroker.com.

## How often does the AmmoSeek engine process its ammunition data?
Every minute or two! AmmoSeek is constantly updating ammunition data 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, automatically. Individual retailers are updated at least hourly, most most are updated much more often. So we're doing all we can to keep things as updated as possible. Still, however, there's always the possibility that items can go out of stock the moment after our site is updated, so it's not always possible to be 100% accurate.

## Hey, I thought you said all items listed are in stock. I clicked on an item and the retailerâ€™s web site tells me it is not in stock. What gives?
We are updating our site constantly. Updates are made every minute or two, 24/7. But things are moving so quicky that there's no way to be 100% accurate. Heck, even the retailer sites themselves aren't even always accurate. Since most retailers are drop-shippers, they obtain their stock information from their distributors only on an hourly basis. So while a site might claim they have 15 left in stock, that info might be an hour old and after you place your order you'll be told that it's really out of stock and you can backorder or get a refund. All of this is completely out of our hands.

If an out-of-item persists in the AmmoSeek results for more than an hour, [contact us](https://ammoseek.com/contact) and we'll look into it.
