# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
## Why don't you show the ammo prices including shipping rates?
We rate each retailer on their average shipping costs. See our Shipping Estimation page for more details. Some sites (e.g. gun-deals.com) purport to factor shipping charges into the price of of the product, but you will notice that not all products have shipping information added in, and the ones that do aren't necessarily accurate since shipping charges vary widely depending on whether or not other items are also purchased at the same time. Plus, some retailers offer free (or very inexpensive) shipping because they already add in the cost of shipping to the price of the product. Therefore, with such varying levels of accuracy, it makes comparison shopping much less clear than if the basic price of the item is used.

## How can I find lead-free ammunition?
Typically entering the keyword `lead-free` into the include keywords search box for a given caliber will yield good results for lead-free / non-lead ammunition.

## Do you sell ammo? What are your shipping rates?
We do not sell ammunition. AmmoSeek is a search engine for finding in-stock ammunition at online retailers. We do not stock or sell ammunition; therefore, we do not have shipping rates.

## Hi, I'm an avid shooter and have some leftover XXX Ammo to sell. How can I sell it on your site?
I'm sorry but we only list in-stock ammo (and related products) for retailers that have an ongoing business selling online via an ecommerce site. There is a great website for what you want to do though. Check out Gunbroker.com.

## How often does the AmmoSeek engine process its ammunition data?
Every minute or two! AmmoSeek is constantly updating ammunition data 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, automatically. Individual retailers are updated at least hourly, most most are updated much more often. So we're doing all we can to keep things as updated as possible. Still, however, there's always the possibility that items can go out of stock the moment after our site is updated, so it's not always possible to be 100% accurate.

## Hey, I thought you said all items listed are in stock. I clicked on an item and the retailer’s web site tells me it is not in stock. What gives?
We are updating our site constantly. Updates are made every minute or two, 24/7. But things are moving so quicky that there's no way to be 100% accurate. Heck, even the retailer sites themselves aren't even always accurate. Since most retailers are drop-shippers, they obtain their stock information from their distributors only on an hourly basis. So while a site might claim they have 15 left in stock, that info might be an hour old and after you place your order you'll be told that it's really out of stock and you can backorder or get a refund. All of this is completely out of our hands.

If an out-of-item persists in the AmmoSeek results for more than an hour, [contact us](https://ammoseek.com/contact) and we'll look into it.

## I see a mistake or discrepancy with the data. Why?
In many cases the sites we mine for data are not sophisticated and will contain inconsistencies themselves. Our software mining engine does its very best to display valid data but there are going to be cases where it will never mine the data properly. It’s the "garbage in, garbage out" evil.

Also, there will be times where retailers modify their site code causing our software to fail at grabbing the proper information or any information at all. In any of these cases please feel free to [contact us](https://ammoseek.com/contact) about it in case we may not already know that the problem exists.

**Please Note: Due to this, we cannot provide any guarantee or warranty that the data provided by AmmoSeek.com is accurate. It is up to you to verify with the retailer the details of any transaction you make. For instance, if we erroneously show an incorrect number of rounds, and you make a purchase based on this error, we will not and cannot be held liable for this error.**

## Why is my favorite caliber or online ammo retailer not listed at AmmoSeek?
We believe we have just about every caliber that is sold by our retailers listed in the AmmoSeek search engine at this time. We started with the most popular calibers and now have over 300 different calibers. If the caliber is available at any of the sites in our indexing engine then we are searching for it.

The retailers we are currently processing are listed on the left side of the main AmmoSeek page. We make an effort to put as many online ammo retailers in the engine as possible. Feel free to [contact us](https://ammoseek.com/contact) with new retailer requests.

**NOTE:** Retailers who wish to be listed in AmmoSeek's search results MUST provide us with a regular data feed of their in-stock products.

## How do I find out about advertising my own product or site on AmmoSeek?
Please see the [advertising information page](https://ammoseek.com/advertising) for current rates and other detailed information

## Wow, I love this AmmoSeek thing. Can I just make a donation to show my appreciation?
Sure, if you wish you can pledge to send us a little extra whiskey money on a regular basis by [donating at our LiberaPay page](https://liberapay.com/AmmoSeek/donate).  However, we also would really appreciate is if you spread the word about us among your friends, enemies, colleagues, and drinking buddies... in person, and on social media.

## What is the best browser to use for AmmoSeek.com?
Any modern browser should work. From Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Vivaldi, Brave, and Edge are the big ones these days. **AmmoSeek is no longer compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer (any version)!**

## Are you affiliated with any of these ammunition retailers in any way?

Yes, some. In an effort to provide the best product data available we invite retailers to participate in the AmmoSeek Certified Retailer program. These retailers provide a product data feed to the AmmoSeek search engine resulting in more accurate data. For others, we scour the retailers' websites for product data with our indexing engine.  Our aim is to find the very best but least expensive ammo for you. Additionally, some retailers have affiliate programs or PPC programs that allow us to monetize links in our search results to the retailers sites. Still others pay what we call "listing fees" which are collected in return for the privilege of being listed in our search engine. This revenue is what keeps AmmoSeek up and running to help fellow Ammo Seekers find the ammo they are looking for at the best prices.

## Do you endorse any retailers over others?

No, not at all. We do not endorse or vet retailers we list. Our only requirement for listing a retailers products is whether they provide us with a conforming product data feed based on our specification. We rely on AmmoSeek users to notify us if any retailers are doing malicious things or are continuing to have poor customer support. If a retailer continues to receive complaints we will (and have) banned the retailer from our listings.


# Ammunition Glossary
Confused by bullet abbreviations an acronyms used by manufacturers? We'll tell you what they mean and how they're used so you can pick the right one. This document was apropriated from an old glossary posted by CheaperThanDirt back when AmmoSeek started, so they deserve most of the credit for this. For some reason it is no longer available on their site, and an AmmoSeeker noticed this and suggested we take over the content ourselves... so we did.

>  ## AP: armor-piercing
> Military bullets with steel or tungsten core that penetrates steel armor. Bullet's tip is usually painted black for easier identification.

> ## API: armor-piercing incendiary
> Designed to penetrate armor and set target on fire. Tips are usually painted light blue.

> ## BBWC: bevel-base wadcutter
> Pistol bullet that's float on both ends; has beveled base to increase accuracy similar to a boat-tail bullet


> ## BEB: brass-enclosed base
> Pistol bullet with brass plug over exposed lead base to reduce lead exposure. Many indoor ranges now specify use of this bullet to decrease lead contamination.

> ## BJHP: brass-jacketed hollow point
> Defensive pistol bullet that controls mushrooming and energy release over longer distances.


> ## BST: Ballistic Silvertip
> Used with hunting rifles, this Winchester bullet has a soft metal tip that causes rapid expansion and penetration of bullet. Typically used for varminting and hunting light- and medium-size game.


> ## BT: boat-tail 
> Rifle bullet with truncated conical shape at base of bullet. Streamlining stabilizes bullet and increases accuracy.


> ## BTHP: boat-tail hollow point
> Same as plain boat-tail but with a hollow point, which generates rapid expansion and penetration.

> ## BTSP: boat-tail soft point
> Like the plain boat-tail but with a soft point to increase penetration and expansion from exposed lead tip.


> ## BRPT: bronze point
> Bronze insert in tip improves trajectory, velocity and energy transfer at extreme ranges. Tip expands rapidly when driven back through bullet. Excellent design for hunting long-range medium-size game.

> ## CC: copper-coated
> Same as full-metal-jacket. Copper coating prevents bullet deformation in feed mechanism and barrel, reduces misfires and lowers risk of barrel damage.

> ## CP: copper-plated
> Lead bullet dipped in copper; reduces lead fouling and is cheaper than copper coating.

> ## CL: Core-Lokt 
> Remington's premier bonded bullet. Retains up to 95% of original weight with maximum penetration and energy transfer. Progressively tapered jacket initiates and controls expansion nearly 2x. Unique design and bonded lead core delivers performance from 50 to 500 yards.

> ## ENCAP: encapsulated
> Totally plated on all sides to decrease environmental lead contamination. Many indoor ranges use this ammunition exclusively to reduce lead clean-up costs.

> ## EFMJ: expanding full metal jacket 
> Federal's answer to areas with restrictions on hollow points. A regular full-metal-jacket bullet with front rubber core covered by a copper jacket. When fired into target media, copper jacket collapses along serrations, produces petal-like expansion and delivers energy without over-penetration.

> ## EP: Expanding Point
> Winchester-developed bullet for .25ACP for better stopping power for small calibers. Hollow point with round lead ball inserted into cavity ensures positive feed, increases expansion and transfers energy rapidly.

> ## ERBT: Extended-Range Boat-tail
> Remington bullet that produces long-range accuracy along with superior stopping power required for hunting.

> ## FMC: full-metal case 
> Lead core fully enclosed with copper, nickel, brass or steel.

> ## FMJ: full-metal jacket 
> A bullet consisting of a soft core, usually made of lead, encased in a shell of harder metal such as copper, cupronickel or steel alloy. Usually the jacket extends on just the front and sides with the rear left as exposed lead, but the outer shell can extend around the entire bullet.

> ## FMJBT: full-metal-jacket boat-tail
> Like FMJ but has a boat-tail to reduce turbulence and increase accuracy.

> ## FMJE: full-metal-jacket encapsulated
> Like FMJ but also has covered base and doesn't expose any lead.

> ## FPJ: flat-point jacketed
> FMJ with a flat point. Most .40 S&W and .30-30 Winchester rounds have this design. The .30-30 Winchester has a tubular magazine and uses a flat-point bullet to prevent accidental detonation during recoil, as front round's primer may come in contact with point of round following it.

> ## FPPN: Flat Point Penetrator
> The Flat Point Penetrator was specifically designed to take down big game in Africa. The bullet features a hard lead core that is surrounded by a copper jacket. The bullet is very accurate and produces bone breaking capabilities in one package.

> ## FNSP: flat-nose soft-point
> Similar to the FPJ but has lead-exposed point that expands on impact. Used for hunting.

> ## FRAN: frangible
> Prevents ricochet by breaking apart on contact. Can be made from empty cartridge cases filled with epoxy and compressed birdshot, metal dust or filings. Developed for air marshals to avoid over-penetration and ricochet aboard airplanes. All energy is transferred to the target, making it a devastating defensive bullet.

> ## GCK: gas check
> Metallic cup or disc is attached to bottom of lead-alloy bullet. Decreases gas blow-by, increases velocity and reduces lead fouling.

> ## GDHP: Gold Dot hollow point 
> Speer's hollow point bullet with jacket bonded to lead core to prevent separation and control expansion and penetration.

> ## GS: Grand Slam 
> Speer's design for hunting big game. Jacket is 45% bigger at base to prevent rollback and retain bullet's weight. Internal jacket flutes ensure proper expansion. Bullet's core is a ternary (three-part) alloy, which is poured into jacket at 900 degrees F to prevent jacket slippage.

> ## HBWC: hollow-base wadcutter 
> Preferred by some target shooters, this flat lead bullet with hollow base punches neat, round holes in paper targets and makes scoring easier. Creates better gas seal to prevent gas blow-by and increase velocity.

> ## HSHK: Hydra-Shok 
Federal's handgun defense bullet. Unique center-post design delivers controlled expansion. Notched jacket transfers energy efficiently and penetrates barriers while retaining stopping power.

> ## HP: hollow point 
> Hollow cavity in bullet's nose allows expansion on impact.

> ## HPBT: hollow point boat-tail <="" p="" style="border: none;">
> Rifle bullet with a truncated conical shape at base of bullet. Hollow cavity in nose allows expansion on impact.

> ## HSP: hollow soft point 
> Exposed lead point and hollow cavity in nose permits expansion on impact.

> ## HV: high velocity
> Ammunition with velocity over 1,200 feet per second.

> ## JFP: jacketed flat point 
> Flat lead point and full metal jacket. All .30-30 Winchesters have this bullet design. The .30-30 Winchester has a tubular magazine and uses a flat-point bullet to prevent accidental detonation during recoil, as front round's primer may come in contact with point of round following it.

> ## JHC: jacketed hollow cavity 
> Jacketed bullet with hole in tip to promote expansion on impact.

> ## JHP: jacketed hollow point 
> Jacketed bullet with hole in tip to promote expansion on impact.

> ## LSWCHP: lead semi-wadcutter hollow point 
> Lubricated solid lead bullet with hollow point. Swaged to form sharp shoulder to produce clean holes in paper targets. Good choice for target practice or general shooting.

> ## MB: multi-ball
> More than one ball or bullet in cartridge to increase hit ratio.

> ## MC: metal case
> Same as metal-jacketed bullet.

> ## MCH: match
> Bullets with most accurate design, weight, materials and consistencies. Used by snipers and target shooters.

> ## MK: MatchKing
> Made to exact tolerances by Sierra. Delivers record-breaking accuracy at long ranges.

> ## MOLY: moly-coated
> Bullet is coated with molybdenum disulfide to reduce friction and increase velocity.

> ## NBT: Nosler Ballistic Tip 
> Nosler developed this bullet with a polycarbonate tip that protects the bullet from damage in the magazine resulting from recoil. The tip also stabilizes the bullet for long-range shooting and insures reliable expansion when the bullet hits its target.

> ## NP: Nosler Partition 
> Has two lead cores separated by bullet jacket. Top part of jacket is thin and promotes expansion of bullet. Bottom part of bullet has thicker jacket that retains bullet's weight, stops fragmentation and increases penetration.

> ## PEP: Positive Expanding Point
> Specially designed by Winchester for extreme accuracy and maximum impact on varmints and medium-size game.

> ## PG: Partition Gold 
> Winchester's proprietary design delivers expansion and penetration on medium- and large-size game at wide range of impact velocities. Rear core is hard lead alloy, locked in place with a heel crimp to prevent core slippage and maximize penetration. Patented steel cup reinforces prevents core distortion at high-impact velocities.

> ## PL: Power-Lokt
> Remington's revolutionary varmint and small-game bullet produces bench rest-level accuracy. Copper jacket is electrolyticly bonded to lead core, producing near-perfect concentricity and gyroscopic balance, once available only in custom-made match bullets. Exceptional sub-minute-of-angle accuracy for small game at extreme ranges.

> ## PP: Power-Point
> Jacketed soft nose from Winchester delivers maximum energy on impact. Notches around jacket's mouth improve upset and ensure uniform, rapid expansion.

> ## PSP & PTDSP: pointed soft point 
> Pointed bullet retains velocity over long ranges. Soft nose initiates rapid bullet expansion. Jacket and core toughness vary according to caliber and weight of bullet.

> ## PTHP: Platinum-Tipped Hollow Point 
> A Winchester design for handgun hunters. Immediately transfers bullet's energy into target. Delivers penetration, expansion and accuracy.

> ## PWC: pointed wadcutter
> Lubricated solid lead with pointed nose. Formed by swaging process with sharp shoulder for clean hole-punching in paper targets. Good choice for target practice or general shooting.

> ## RN: round nose 
> Round nose promotes positive, reliable feeding.

> ## SBK: Sierra BlitzKing
> Used for varmint hunting; has plastic tip inserted into bullet cavity, which expands on impact and delivers high ballistic coefficient.

> ## SFS: Supreme Fail Safe
> Hollow point bullet with lead core and steel insert. Delivers controlled expansion, deeper penetration and bullet weight retention.

> ## SJHP: semi-jacketed hollow point 
> Exposed lead tip expands more rapidly than jacketed hollow point design. Controlled penetration provides maximum energy transfer, making it suitable for hunting.

> ## SJSP: semi-jacketed soft point 
> Exposed lead soft point with reliable expansion and deeper penetration than hollow point bullets. Copper jacket and swaged lead core improve concentricity, balance and accuracy.

> ## SLD: solid 
> Usually made from copper, bronze or brass alloy - but no lead. Designed for deep penetration in thick-skinned animals.

> ## SMP: semi-pointed
> Same penetration as a round nose with better trajectory, higher velocity and energy transfer, better expansion control and deeper penetration than a hollow point. At close range, usually offers better penetration and more controlled expansion. Excellent accuracy potential and often used for short- to medium-range hunting.

> ## SP: soft point
> Exposed lead tip and broader point diameter provides rapid, controlled expansion at somewhat lower velocities.

> ## SPCE: soft point cutting edge 
> Semi-jacketed with cut-through jacket edge to partially lock in lead core. Deforms less in light game than heavy game. Used for clawed game hunting.

> ## SPCL: soft point Core-Lokt 
> Locks progressively heavier jacketed mid-section to lead core, preventing separation but allowing maximum energy transfer. Stays together on impact, expands in a controlled manner and mushrooms uniformly to nearly twice the original diameter.

> ## SPT: spitzer
> Pointed bullet normally used in modern military rifles.

> ## SST: Super Shock Tipped
> Hornady's design incorporates a pointed polymer tip that improves ballistic coefficient and increases velocity, accuracy and downrange power. Specially designed jacket grips and controls expanding core, allowing maximum expansion while retaining mass and momentum.

> ## ST: Silvertip
> Winchester's design has a special aluminum-alloy nose cap to protect lead core; delivers deep penetration and has controlled expansion in small- and medium-size game.

> ## STHP: Silvertip Hollow Point 
> Winchester's handgun bullet designed for rapid, controlled expansion to penetrate thin skin, light muscle and bone of small- to medium-size game.

> ## SWC/SW: semi-wadcutter 
> Lubricated solid lead bullet with semi-pointed nose. Formed by swaging process, resulting in a sharp shoulder for clean hole-punching in paper targets. Good choice for target practice or general shooting.

> ## SXT: Supreme Expansion Technology 
> Winchester's personal protection bullet. Designed with reverse tapered jacket, has uniform expansion, greater accuracy and reliable firearm functioning.
