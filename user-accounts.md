## Why sign up for an account?

You can quickly and easily set up an account at AmmoSeek.com. Why would you do this?

1. **See more than 100 search results**. Anonymous users get to see only 100 results for any search. If you're logged in you can view multiple pages of results.
1. **You can save bookmark-style links to your favorite searches**. Once you've crafted a search to find what you want, you can "save" that search and then from that moment forth, the same search is only a single click away. See: [Saving Searches](saving-searches).
1. **You can receive email and SMS/text price alerts**. If you wish to be notified when a particular product hits a specified price threshold, you can set an alert. We'll automatically check every few minutes and let you know instantly if your price threshold is met. See [Setting Alerts](alerts).
1. **Exclude Retailers** you don't like from your search results, permanently. Maintain a list of any/all retailers you wish to ignore.
1. **Rate & Review retailers**. Submit reviews for retailers you've used to let others know your experiences.
1. **Custom Color Themes** - change the color scheme of the entire site to something that suits you better!

## Verifying your email address

After you submit a request for an account, you will need to verify that the email address you entered is indeed yours.

NOTE: If you submitted a mobile phone number, you'll need to verify that as well as a separate process. See Verifying your mobile phone number.

- Go to your email and find the message that was dispatched to you. It will have a subject line of: **ACTION REQUIRED: Verify your account with AmmoSeek.com**
- Inside that email will be a link that, when clicked, will verify that you indeed own the email address you entered when you created your account.
- Click that link, and then you will be allowed to log into AmmoSeek.com using the same SignUpSignInButton.png button.

***If you cannot find the verification email***:

Check your "spam" or "bulk" mail folder. If this happens, use the mechanisms within you email client to make sure that messages from admin@ammoseek.com are no longer treated as spam.
If you still can't find the email, go to our main page where you'll see a message containing a link to resend your verification email. If you continue to have trouble, please email us at admin@ammoseek.com from the same account you attempted to sign up with, and we'll do our best to assist you.
