1. **See more than 100 search results**. Anonymous users get to see only 100 results for any search. If you're logged in you can view multiple pages of results.
1. **You can save bookmark-style links to your favorite searches**. Once you've crafted a search to find what you want, you can "save" that search and then from that moment forth, the same search is only a single click away. See: [Saving Searches](saving-searches).
1. **You can receive email and SMS/text price alerts**. If you wish to be notified when a particular product hits a specified price threshold, you can set an alert. We'll automatically check every few minutes and let you know instantly if your price threshold is met. See [Setting Alerts](alerts).
1. **Exclude Retailers** you don't like from your search results, permanently. Maintain a list of any/all retailers you wish to ignore.
1. **Rate & Review retailers**. Submit reviews for retailers you've used to let others know your experiences.
