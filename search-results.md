<!-- SUBTITLE: How to read the search results at AmmoSeek.com -->

The search results pages contains a lot of information you might find useful. Most fields (Retailer Name, Description, Manufacturer, Caliber, etc.) are self explanatory. Below is some additional info:

Share - clicking the Share.png icon lets you easily share the product via social channels (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.)
When - this column tell you how long it's been since our database has been updated for this product.
Limits - this column alerts you if the retailer has any set purchase limits for the product (e.g. max Limit1.png box per customer)
New? - this column lets you know if the product is in factory new condition (New.png), remanufactured (Remanufactured.png), or factory seconds (FactorySeconds.png)
S/H - this column gives you our metered rating for the average shipping costs for retailer in question. See details on our Shipping Estimation here.
Err? - If you notice a discrepancy in our data, click the green flag (GreenFlag.png) to let us know what's wrong. If there's already a Discrepancy.png symbol, it means someone else has already submitted a discrepancy report for that item.
NOTE: on mobile devices, the results page will have only a few basic fields, with an extra Details button you can click to see everything:
