<!-- SUBTITLE: How to read the search results at AmmoSeek.com -->

The search results pages contains a lot of information you might find useful. Most fields (Retailer Name, Description, Manufacturer, Caliber, etc.) are self explanatory. Below is some additional info:

> **Share** - clicking the ![Share](/uploads/share.png "Share") icon lets you easily share the product via social channels (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.)
> **When** - this column tell you how long it's been since our database has been updated for this product.
> **Limits** - this column alerts you if the retailer has any set purchase limits for the product (e.g. max ![Limit 1](/uploads/limit-1.png "Limit 1"){.align-center} box per customer)
> **New?** - this column lets you know if the product is in factory new condition (![New](/uploads/new.png "New")), remanufactured (![Remanufactured](/uploads/remanufactured.png "Remanufactured")), or factory seconds (![Factoryseconds](/uploads/factoryseconds.png "Factoryseconds"))
> **S/H ** - this column gives you our metered rating for the average shipping costs for retailer in question. [See details on our Shipping Estimation here](https://a.ammoseek.com/shipping_estimation/).
> **Err?** - If you notice a discrepancy in our data, click the green flag (GreenFlag.png) to let us know what's wrong. If there's already a Discrepancy.png symbol, it means someone else has already submitted a discrepancy report for that item.

**NOTE**: on mobile devices, the results page will have only a few basic fields, with an extra **Details** button you can click to see everything:
